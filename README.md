# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

3. What to show on the add new chapter?

Answer 1 :
-> Add Name of the Subject/ Book.
-> Add Image for the Book.
-> Select Type (Mids , Finals).
-> Have options to set as normal, important, medium etc.
-> Have options to mark as pending, Remaining, Completed.
That's it for now I think.

Answer 2 :
-> Options of edit,delete on the card like three dots on the left side and when user hovers/clicks it will show edit and delete options.
-> Delete will show a confirmation message.
-> Edit will show a form with already created details like Image,Name,Type (mids,finals) and he can edit this and save.

Answer 3 :
-> Name of the chapter.
-> Image optional if he wants he can add or show the default card for the chapter.
-> Upload multiple images through drag and drop (for now only images).
-> Save the chapter (that's it for now).

Answer 4 : 
-> Name of the chapter will be shown (not edit-able) and he is shown a drap and drop input option or like that to add more photos and save.

Answer 5 :
-> On the edit section of the Book the user will be able to update the status of the Books.
